# hello-world
Just another repository.
My name is Bradley Edwin and I am an avid Wordpress Website Designer. I started this career as a hobby, designing websites for friends and family and it turned out that more and more people started requesting my service. This eventually steered me into starting a web design company.
I hate starting my morning without coffee!
